<hr>
<div class="w3-card"><b>A bank is a financial
institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand
deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be
directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.</b></div>
<div class="panel panel-default text-primary">Because
banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of
a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over
banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as
fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal
to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other
regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject
to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of
capital standards, the Basel Accords.</div>

<div class="panel panel-default text-success">Banking in
its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous
cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a
continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their
roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of
banking dynasties &mdash; notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the
Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds &mdash; have played a
central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest
existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</div>
<h4>Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)</h4>
<strong><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></strong>A&nbsp;Unit
Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is an integrated plan which offers life
insurance cover and investment through a single scheme. Investment in
ULIPs is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum
and the maturity proceeds of a ULIP are also exempt under Section
10(10)(D). ULIPs specify a life insurance cover (usually around 10
times your annual premium) and they allow you to choose ULIP funds
which invest in equities and/or debt and function very similar to
mutual funds. The minimum annual investment varies from fund to fund
but is usually set at Rs 2,500. There is no maximum limit but tax
deduction is only available for contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh per
year.<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong></strong>
<h4>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)</h4>
<div class="container text-warning">ELSS or Equity Linked
Savings Scheme is a type of mutual fund. ELSS Funds have a lock-in of 3
years, which is the shortest lock-in among the various tax-saving
schemes in India. Investing in ELSS Funds (also called Tax Saving
Funds) is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per
annum. The returns on ELSS funds will be taxed as long term capital
gains at a 10% rate. Dividends from ELSS funds will also be taxed at
10% under the Dividend Distribution Tax. ELSS funds invest at least 80%
of their assets in equity (stocks) and offer a high compounding
potential in the long term. You can know more about them here. The
minimum annual investment in ELSS funds is Rs 100, although it varies
from one fund to another. There is no maximum limit but tax deduction
is only available for contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year.</div>
Interest rate: Rate of return is not fixed, depends on ELSS fund
performance. Tenure : 3 years (minimum), no maximum tenure Minimum
Investment: Rs 100. Different for different ELSS funds Maximum
Investment: None Deduction on Principal: Yes Tax on interest: Taxable
at 10% (LTCG) Government Savings Schemes Mostly, government schemes are
perceived as good investments due reliability, security and
dependability. Let&rsquo;s take a look at them :<span>&nbsp;</span><strong
 text-info="" style="font-weight: normal;">This
certificate offers an interest rate of 6.8% compounded annually but
payable only at maturity. It can be purchased from any post office. The
minimum investment is Rs 100 and there is no maximum limit. The tenure
for this certificate is 5 years. The interest earned is deemed to be
reinvested and eligible for tax deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh under
Section 80 C. The principal amount invested also counts towards the
same tax deduction up to Rs 1.5 lakh. The current issue is called the
NSC VIII Issue.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Post
Office Savings Account This account is like a savings account with a
bank, except that it is held with a post office. Only one account can
be opened with one post office and can be transferred from one post
office to another. You can also open an account in the name of a minor.
The interest rate is 4% and is fully taxable. However a deduction of Rs
10,000 per annum is available on your total savings account interest
including post office savings interest under Section 80TTA of the
Income Tax Act, 1961. The minimum balance for non-cheque account is Rs.
50 and Rs. 500 for accounts with cheque facility
